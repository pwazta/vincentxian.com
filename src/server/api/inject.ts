 * Dependency Injection Configuration

 * - Easy testing by mocking the database
 * - Environment-specific configurations
 * - Service lifecycle management
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Production: Real database and services
 * - Testing: Mock database and services
 * - Development: Debug-enabled services
