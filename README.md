A **3D portfolio website** featuring a retro low-poly environment I modeled myself. Built with React Three Fiber and T3 stack, this interactive site showcases my work in software, game design, and 3D art. Best experienced on desktop with a mouse (click & drag to navigate) -- hope you have fun and maybe you'll be inspired to make something cool of your own! :)
